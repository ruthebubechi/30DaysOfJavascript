# 30DaysOfJavascript

# Day1

# Comments

I learnt that comments makes our code readable and it is a good practice to use comment as a programmer.

# JavaScript to web page

I understood the different ways JavaScript can be added to the web page. I use Multiple External Scripts so well in my code but I just go to know it is called that.

# Data types

I was introduced to all the data types in JavaScript and I practiced some example to check for data types.

# Variables

I understood better how variables are declared in JavaScript using the let and const keyword. The let variable are changeable but the const variable is not.
